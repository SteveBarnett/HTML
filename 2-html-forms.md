# HTML forms

HTML is static: something has to catch the `form`.

* `form` (method, action)
* `input` text, `name` attribute, `id` attribute
* `input` submit
* password
* `label`, `for` attribute (UX, accessibility)
* hidden
* `textarea`
* radio, select, option (pick one)
* checkbox (pick many)
* file
* `fieldset`, `legend` (semantics, UX, accessibility)

There is a way to gather data using someone else's server (and their API), which we'll [come back to later](formspree.html).
